# Predicting Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk

## Problem Statement
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within 10 years based on demographic, behavioral, and medical data. This is a binary classification problem, where the output indicates whether the patient is at risk (1) or not (0).

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict the likelihood of developing CHD.
- **Dataset**: Includes features like age, gender, cholesterol, smoking habits, and more.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Features
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Conclusion
This project shows how machine learning can aid in the early detection of coronary heart disease, improving health outcomes.
